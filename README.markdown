# React Microscope

React Microscope is [Microscope](https://github.com/DiscoverMeteor/Microscope) implemented 
in React.js instead of Blaze(Meteor's rendering library). It uses the recently announced [React.js support packages](http://react-in-meteor.readthedocs.org). 

[FlowRouter](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router) is used for routing. The existing server-side code and the stylesheets have been used without any modifications. A good deal of the client-side code including
helpers, templates were copied almost verbatim with a few minor modifications.
